DP Recipe API
=============

### Getting started

This repo contains 2 executables - the recipe API and a recipe checker app.
The recipe API can be run by running `make debug` and the recipe checker can be
run by running `make checker` (but has some prerequisites, documented below).

### Healthcheck

The endpoint `/health` checks the connection to the database and returns
one of:

* success (200, JSON "status": "OK")
* failure (500, JSON "status": "error").
